class LopperTree:
    """Class for walking a device tree, and providing callbacks at defined points

    This class implements:
       - a node iterator
       - dictionary access to nodes by path or node number
       - a tree walker / exec() that has callbacks for: tree start, node start,
         property start, node end, tree end
       - debug level
       - tree wide reference tracking control: clear, get
       - sync(): to sync changes to a backing FDT
       - export(): to export the tree description as a dictionary
       - node manipulatins: add, delete, filter, subnodes
       - phandle access to nodes
       - label access to nodes
       - node search by regex

    A LopperTree object is instantiated for an easier/structure interface to a backing
    device tree store (currently only a flattened device tree from libfdt). It provides
    the ability to add/delete/manipulate nodes on a tree wide basis and can sync those
    changes to the backing store.

    When initialized, the tree is created from an exported description of the
    FDT. If the changes made by the tree  are to be indepdendent, then the FDT
    should not be re-exported and loaded by the tree. But if other components are
    changing the FDT, it can be reloaded to synchronize the tree and the backing
    store.

    During the walking of a tree via exec(), callbacks are made (if set) at defined
    points in the process. This makes it easy to implement structured output of a
    tree, without the need to have deep encoding/understanding of the underlying
    structure.

    Callbacks are functions of the form: <fn>( <node or property>, FDT )

    Attributes:
       - __nodes__: The nodes of the tree, ordered by absolute path indexing
       - __nnodes__: The nodes of the tree, ordered by node number
       - __pnodes__: The nodes of the tree, ordered by phandle
       - __dbg__: treewide debug level
       - __must_sync__: flag, true when the tree must be syncd to the FDT
       - __current_node__: The current node in an iteration
       - __start_node__: The starting node for an iteration
       - __new_iteration__: Flag set to start a new iteration
       - __node_iter__: The current iterator
       - start_tree_cb, start_node_cb, end_node_cb, property_cb, end_tree_cb: callbacks
       - depth_first: not currently implemented
       - strict: Flag indicating if strict property resolution should be enforced
